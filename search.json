My research explores vulnerable groups’ understanding of misinformation, disinformation, fake news and generative AI. This is with an aim to build their skills in recognising misleading/misinforming/ai-generated content.\nMy PhD research explored misinformation spread and correction within close-tie networks, investigating how technology could support misinformation correction when it is shared within groups of close ties (such as friend or family networks)."
