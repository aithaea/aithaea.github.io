I am a passionate PhD student in the Computer and Information Sciences Department at Northumbria University who is a member of the Northumbria Social Computing research group and a visiting PhD researcher at University College London within the Information Security Research Group. I am currently conducting interdisciplinary research around misinformation and family communications, and I am also interested in research surrounding digital learning tools.
