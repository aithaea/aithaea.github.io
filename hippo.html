    <h2>Recent Pygmy Hippo Births: A Bright Future for a Rare Species</h2>
    <img src="img/Photo1.png" alt="Pygmy hippo calf with mother" style="width:75%; margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:12.5%">
    <p><strong>Edinburgh, Scotland:</strong> Excitement is brewing at Edinburgh Zoo following the birth of a baby pygmy hippo, named Haggis, on October 30, 2024. The female calf, weighing just 8 pounds at birth, has captured the attention of visitors and conservationists alike. This is the zoo's first pygmy hippo birth in 20 years, a significant milestone for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland.</p>
    <p><strong>Athens, Greece:</strong> At Attica Zoological Park, a male pygmy hippo calf was born on February 19, 2024, to Lizzie and Jamal. Weighing 20 pounds at birth, this calf is the first of its kind born at the zoo in 15 years. The staff at Attica Zoo shared photos of the baby, nicknamed "Apollo," showing him waddling near the water's edge and taking his first swim. The zoo announced that they plan to open a new pygmy hippo exhibit later this year to celebrate the birth.</p>
    <p><img src="img/Photo2.png" alt="Pygmy hippo baby close-up" style="width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;">Haggis' parents, Otto and Gloria, have been part of a carefully managed breeding program aimed at bolstering the population of pygmy hippos in captivity. Zoo officials reported that the young calf is thriving, frequently seen exploring her enclosure and snuggling up to her mother. Visitors are encouraged to participate in a naming contest for Haggis, which will run through December.</p>
    <p>While pygmy hippos are native to Southeast Asia, conservation efforts have expanded globally due to habitat loss and poaching in the wild. The World Wildlife Federation estimates their population in the wild to be fewer than 1,000 individuals, making every birth in captivity crucial for the species' survival.</p>
    <p>Both births highlight the importance of international cooperation in conserving endangered species. Conservationists hope these events will inspire public interest in the plight of pygmy hippos and encourage continued efforts to protect their habitats.</p>
